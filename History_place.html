                In 1632, King Fasilidas proclaimed that Gondar, a previously obscure village, would become the site of the Empire’s new capital. The population consequently swelled to over 60,000 and for the next 250 years, the Kings of Ethiopia ruled from Gondar. Beginning with Fasilidas, a succession of Ethiopian kings built the castles that still occupy the heart of modern day Gondar. Known collectively as the Royal Enclosure or
“Fasil Ghebbi”, the castles have survived several wars.

                The early history of Ethiopia (also called Abyssinia) begins with the glorious but little-known kingdom of Axum (Aksum). The origins of the Axumite state date back to the middle of the 2nd century BC. At the height of its power, between the 4th and 7th centuries AD, the Axumite kingdom controlled most of present-day Ethiopia, including territories in the southern parts of the Arabian Peninsula. The Axumite rulers were in regular diplomatic and commercial contact with the Egyptian, Greek, Byzantine, and Persian empires. The achievements of this grand culture are recorded today in the ruins of its cities, reservoirs, temples, and, most remarkably.

                Hidden for centuries in the remote highlands, about 700 kilometers north of Addis Ababa, the magnificent
                rock-hewn churches of Lalibela are not to be missed by today’s visitors. This group of eleven monolithic
                and semi-monolithic structures was carved directly into the stone of the mountainside at least 800 years
                ago.

While Christianity was introduced and accepted by the nation of Ethiopia very early, Islam also arrived at the outskirts of the Ethiopian Empire not long after Mohammed began spreading his faith on the nearby Arabian Peninsula.
